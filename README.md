# OmegaT Bootcamp

This is a self-paced [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/) course for language experts and project managers. It is brought to you by [cApStAn](https://www.capstan.be), initially conceived and developed to train cApStAn's subcontractors (language experts, translators, reviewers and verifiers) and partners who need to use OmegaT. However, it is free to use for anyone interested in learning to use OmegaT, from zero to zen. Contributions (suggestions for better wording, new topics, flagged typos or errata, etc.) are also welcome.



Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

Requirements for the video platform:
- unfinished episodes should resume where the user stopped watching
- it should show what episodes were completed
- it should show progress of the user in case they resume some time afterwards (the user must log in)

The platform should include facility to create quizzes between the lessons.


Episodes should be short, to the point, focused on one thing only, about 5 minutes
Solution to the exercises could be a separate episode.

Intro
- face: why learning OmegaT?

-> less suffering doing things the wrong way

This course is free of charge, and its purpose is to contribute to the OmegaT community and pay back for this great tool that we all own and we can can use for free.

language experts = translators and reviewrs, verifiers etc.
