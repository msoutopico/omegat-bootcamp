# Information for contributors

To contribute to this repository you need to have a basic understanding of git (to push changes) and of markdown (to edit files).

There are two possible environments you can use to manage your contributions:

- [Atom editor](https://atom.io/): allows to fetch and push files as well as to preview changes in the same environment.
- [Typora](https://atom.io/) + [Github](https://desktop.github.com/): Typora is an awesome markdown editor but you will have to manage git transfers separately (e.g. with the Github desktop app).

These are the steps you must follow to

1. Ask the maintainer of the repository to give you PR rights (#TEST)
2. Clone the repository in your local machine or, if you already did that, fetch and pull the latest version.
3. Make changes to the repository
4. Stage your changed/new changed files, commit and push.

```
git pull https://github.com/msoutopico/omegat-bootcamp.git main
```


in server:
1. Pull
2. sude R
3. render_site
4. q y

rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')

git pull

authenticate

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


It's important that you fetch the latest versions every time you intend to push changes, to make sure you work on the latest version and avoid conflicts.
